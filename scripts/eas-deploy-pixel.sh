# eas-deploy-pixel.sh — kick off `eas build --local --profile production`,
# fail fast if the determined versionCode won't install on the device,
# install + run perf-suite if it will.
#
# Why fail-fast: eas-cli prints "Incrementing versionCode from N to M"
# in the [CONFIGURE_ANDROID_VERSION] phase, which runs ~60 seconds into
# a 20-minute build. If M is less than the device's current versionCode,
# the install at the end of the build will fail with
# INSTALL_FAILED_VERSION_DOWNGRADE — so detect at line ~20 of the log
# and abort, saving ~19 min.
#
# Env overrides:
#   PIXEL_SERIAL — adb device serial (default: Ben's Pixel)
#   PACKAGE      — Android package id (default: com.lightningpiggy.app)
