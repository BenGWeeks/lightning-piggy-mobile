//   1. listings  — kinds 30018 / 30402 by followed authors only. Friends'
//                  kind-5 deletions are NOT requested here: in practice they
//                  are ~95 % of what a combined query returns (deletions of
//                  ordinary notes), each costs a schnorr verify, and they
//                  crowd real listings out of the per-batch `limit`.
//   2. deletions — kind 5 that reference the listings pass 1 actually found
//                  (`#a` address or `#e` id), by those listings' authors. A
//                  handful of events instead of hundreds, and it still honours
//                  deletions that lack the optional NIP-09 `k` tag.
