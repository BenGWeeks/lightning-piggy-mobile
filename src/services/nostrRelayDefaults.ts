 * The app's built-in relay lists (#1326). Kept apart from `nostrService` so
 * they're easy to audit, and so `nostrRelayDefaults.test.ts` can fail the
 * build if a relay known to be dead comes back.
 *
 * Checked 2026-10-11 from three networks (War Machine, black-panther, an
 * external fetcher): connect + EOSE time, NIP-11, whether an unknown key may
 * write, and how far back the relay serves events. Rules:
 *  - every list has at least 3 healthy relays run by different operators;
 *  - nos.lol / nostr.mom (one server, intermittently unreachable /
 *    rate-limited for some IPs) only appear as an extra alongside enough
 *    healthy relays, never as a list's backbone;
 *  - relay.nostr.band, relay.nostr.net and relay.nsec.app are gone (dead);
 *  - relay.snort.social isn't used: it's an in-memory relay (memlay) that
 *    serves nothing older than about an hour.
 * `./relayHealth` skips whichever of these is down at runtime.
