/**
 * Patch an NWC provider's relay pool so `publish` resolves as soon as the
 * event has been sent, instead of waiting for a NIP-20 `OK`.
 *
 * The LNbits Nostrclient relay proxy never sends `OK`
 * (https://github.com/lnbits/nostrclient/issues/52), so without this every
 * NIP-47 request would sit on the publish until the SDK's timeout — the
 * foreground connection would never pay, and the background payment poll
 * would hit its 25 s deadline on every pass and silently notify nothing.
 * Shared by `nwcService.connect` / `reconnect` and the read-only
 * `backgroundPaymentTransport`, so every provider we build gets it. Can be
 * removed once lnbits/nostrclient#68 is merged upstream.
 *
 * `onPublishError` receives the fire-and-forget rejection (relay unreachable,
 * temp-ban, rate-limit …). The foreground path feeds it into the per-wallet
 * relay-health state; the background path stays side-effect free.
