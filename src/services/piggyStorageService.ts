/**
 * Local registry of LNURL-withdraw "Piggies" the user has hidden. Stored
 * in SecureStore because the LNURL string is a bearer token: anyone who
 * gets it can claim until the issuer-side cap is hit. Keeping it out of
 * AsyncStorage limits exposure to other apps + adb pulls on rooted dev
 * devices.
 *
 * Used by the Hunt feature (#468). The user creates the LNURL-w in
 * their wallet of choice (LNbits, Alby, Mutiny, …) and pastes it here
 * — see project memory `No LNbits-specific APIs`.
 *
 * Published as a **NIP-GC kind 37516** geocache listing marked with a
 * NIP-32 label (`["L","com.lightningpiggy.app"]` +
 * `["l","payout-lnurl-w","com.lightningpiggy.app"]`) — generic NIP-GC
 * clients (treasures.to, etc.) ignore the label and render the cache
 * as a standard listing, while LP recognises it and routes the finder
 * through HuntFoundScreen. **The LNURL bearer token is deliberately
 * NEVER on the wire** — it lives only on the physical NFC tag / QR
 * and in this SecureStore. See `feedback_lnurl_never_on_relays.md` and
 * `buildCacheListing` in `nostrPlacesService.ts` (which has a
 * security unit test asserting the absence). The `wait` / `uses`
 * fields below are local-only at present (used by the M5/M6 UI for
 * cooldown estimation) — the matching extension tags were considered
 * during design but dropped to avoid side-channel discoverability of
 * the cache's economics. Smart defaults: D=1, T=1, S=micro,
 * t=traditional — matching an NFC-tag Piggy anyone can find.

// Migration: the old key never wrote successfully on Android, so
