// back, so caching the positive result lets cold starts render the
// "Paid" badge immediately without an NWC round-trip. Negative
// (`settled: false`) entries are kept too, with a TTL, so a quick
// bubble re-mount inside the TTL window doesn't cause redundant
// lookupInvoice calls. Past the TTL the cache is treated as absent and
// the caller should re-fetch.
