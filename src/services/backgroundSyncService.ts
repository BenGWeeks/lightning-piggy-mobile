/**
 * backgroundSyncService — the context-free worker the native background
 * host (Android WorkManager / iOS BGTaskScheduler, via expo-background-task)
 * runs to surface OS notifications while the app's UI isn't mounted (#279).
 *
 * DETECT-AND-PING design: this NEVER decrypts. It only detects that new
 * encrypted traffic arrived and fires a GENERIC "you have new messages"
 * notification; the app decrypts and shows the real content when the user
 * opens it. That choice is deliberate:
 *   - It works for BOTH nsec and Amber users — Amber can't decrypt in the
 *     background (it needs its foreground app to approve), so a
 *     decrypt-in-background design would silently exclude Amber users.
 *   - No plaintext is ever produced off-screen — matches the privacy-first
 *     lock-screen default.
 *   - Far less code runs headless (no signer, no gift-wrap unwrap).
 *
 * Freshness is tracked by EVENT ID, not by a `created_at` cursor. NIP-59
 * randomises a gift wrap's `created_at` up to two days into the PAST to
 * thwart timing analysis, so a genuinely-new kind-1059 wrap can arrive
 * carrying an already-old timestamp. A `since`/`created_at` gate would let
 * the relay filter such a wrap out and silently miss real NIP-17 traffic
 * (Copilot review #282). So we query a window wide enough to span the
 * maximum backdate and dedupe against a persisted set of seen ids.
 *
 * Runs in a SEPARATE JS context from the React tree, so it reads everything
 * it needs from storage and talks to relays directly via the shared
 * nostr-tools pool. It must be cheap and self-terminating: open a query,
 * decide whether to ping, persist the seen-set, return.
