/**
 * "Delete a Piglet" — the belt-and-suspenders removal of an owned
 * kind-37516 listing (#777):
 *
 *   1. (belt) Republish the listing with its NIP-40 `expiration` tag
 *      pinned to now, so the app's own client-side expiry filter
 *      (`HuntScreen` / `MapScreen` drop `expiresAt <= now`) hides it
 *      everywhere immediately — even on relays that ignore NIP-09.
 *   2. (suspenders) THEN send a NIP-09 kind-5 deletion request so
 *      compliant relays purge the event outright.
 *
 * Strictly ordered: expire first, delete second. The pure builders are
 * exported (and unit-tested) independently of the publish pipeline; the
 * `deletePiggy` orchestrator wires them to the signer + relay layer.
 *
 * Only the owner (the local signer) can do this — the caller gates on
 * `author == pubkey` before invoking. Orphaned dev events we no longer
 * hold a key for go through `devEventDenylist.ts` instead.

 * replacement, the app's `expiresAt <= now` filter drops the Piglet
 * from every surface regardless of whether the relay honours NIP-09.
 *
 * `created_at` is also pinned to `nowSec` (overriding `buildCacheListing`'s
 * internal `Date.now()` stamp) so it never drifts a second past the kind-5
 * deletion — which stamps `nowSec` too. If the listing ended up *newer*
 * than the deletion, NIP-09 relays that ignore a deletion older than its
 * target could leave the replacement standing. Equal timestamps keep the
 * deletion's `created_at <= target` covering the replacement we just made.
 *
 * The LNURL bearer never reaches the wire — `buildCacheListing` is the
 * single chokepoint that enforces that invariant (asserted in
 * `nostrPlacesService.test.ts`).
