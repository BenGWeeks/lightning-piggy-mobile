/**
 * Relay pool for the market feed and seller snapshots, with structure-only
 * checks at the relay layer.
 *
 * Why a second pool: nostr-tools binds `verifyEvent` per relay connection, so
 * the shared pool can't skip signatures for one subscription. A follow set's
 * listings run to ~1,200 events and a schnorr check costs ~25 ms on a phone,
 * so the shared pool's eager check pinned the JS thread for tens of seconds
 * (#1274). The shared pool keeps verifying every kind for everyone else (the
 * product page reads listings through it).
 *
 * Contract: nothing from this pool is trusted. snapshot services
 * verify every event before use — deletions before they can hide anything,
 * listings lazily (winning revisions only, up to the render cap).
 *
 * Connections are opened per snapshot and closed when the last running
 * snapshot finishes, so this never keeps duplicate sockets open.
