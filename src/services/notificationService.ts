/**
 * notificationService — single integration point for OS-level
 * notifications surfaced from anywhere in the app (DM rumors, group
 * messages, incoming on-chain / Lightning payments, zaps).
 *
 * Architectural commitments (see docs/architecture/notifications.adoc):
 *
 * 1. Local-first: NO Google Play Services needed. The app must work on
 *    GrapheneOS, microG, and other un-googled devices, so every alert with
 *    content is an `expo-notifications` LOCAL notification. The one remote
 *    path is the OPT-IN Marmot push (MIP-05, off by default): a
 *    content-free "New message" wake via FCM / APNs and our notification
 *    server — see marmotPushRegistration.ts / marmotPushWake.ts. Background wake-up
 *    (so we can decide to fire a notification while the UI isn't mounted)
 *    is done by `expo-background-task` — WorkManager on Android,
 *    BGTaskScheduler on iOS (see src/services/backgroundTask.ts) — both
 *    FCM-free. On Android there is ALSO an opt-in realtime path: a
 *    persistent foreground service holding a live relay socket
 *    (src/services/backgroundDmService.ts; manifest perms in
 *    plugins/withForegroundService.js) that posts content notifications
 *    the moment a message arrives — still local-only, no FCM.
 *
 * 2. Permission is requested once, from the foreground, at app launch via
 *    `requestNotificationPermission()`. Fire paths only ever *check*
 *    permission (`hasNotificationPermission()`) and never prompt — a
 *    headless/background task must not present a permission dialog.
 *
 * 3. Per-channel mute. Android 8+ channels split notifications into
 *    "Messages" and "Payments" so the user can mute one without the
 *    other from system Settings. Per-channel UI inside the app is a
 *    follow-up.
 *
 * 4. Privacy. Notification body content (e.g. decrypted DM plaintext)
 *    is NOT sent to the lock screen by default — we show a generic
 *    "New message" until the user explicitly opts in. See
 *    `setLockScreenContentEnabled`.
 *
 * 5. Generic foundation. Callers fire typed `NotificationPayload`
 *    objects rather than each call site assembling raw expo arguments.
 *    This is the seam that lets us swap the backing library or add
 *    grouping / quiet hours / badge counts later without touching the
 *    triggers.
