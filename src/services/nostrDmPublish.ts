 * Publish a batch of gift-wraps to a relay set, capturing each relay's
 * per-wrap accept/reject (`Promise.allSettled` over the per-relay promises
 * `pool.publish` returns) and folding them into a single `DeliveryStatus`.
 *
 * `wrapsPublished` keeps the old `Promise.any` threshold — a wrap counts as
 * published once ≥1 relay accepts it. `errors` records, per fully-failed wrap,
 * the FIRST rejecting relay's message (a concrete relay error, deliberately
 * NOT the old `AggregateError` "all promises were rejected" text). The added
 * `delivery` field carries the per-relay detail for the bubble's tick; #856 is
 * delivery VISIBILITY only — the retry/outbox work is #857.
 *
 * `publish(relays, event)` returns one promise per relay, in the same order as
 * `relays` — so a settle maps back to its relay URL by index. The pool is
 * injected so this module stays a leaf (no `nostrService` import cycle).
 *
 * Stale-socket auto-retry: the shared SimplePool has no ping/keepalive, so
 * after Android doze or a Wi-Fi→cellular handover its sockets can be half-open
 * — "connected" as far as the pool knows, but black holes on the wire. Every
 * publish then dies on nostr-tools' ~4.4s "publish timed out" until the OS
 * finally closes the socket (minutes later), which is why a manual Re-publish
 * eventually worked. When an attempt publishes NOTHING and at least one relay
 * failed transport-shaped, we force-close those relays (dropping the stale
 * sockets) and retry the whole batch once — the automatic equivalent of the
 * manual Re-publish. Live relay rejections (e.g. "blocked:") don't trigger it.
