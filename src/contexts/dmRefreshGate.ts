 * Pure freshness-cursor logic for `refreshDmInbox` (#788). The hook holds a

 * COMPLETED refresh, `0` before any has finished) that drives three
 * decisions. Extracting them keeps `useDmInbox` under the file-size cap and,
 * more importantly, makes the cold-start ↔ abort interaction unit-testable
 * without standing up the whole hook + relay/decrypt stack.
 *
 * The load-bearing invariant: an ABORTED refresh must not advance the cursor.
 * If it did, the next refresh would (a) see `isColdStart === false` and skip
 * the cold-start macro-task yield (#788), and (b) be wrongly suppressed by the
 * TTL freshness gate even though no refresh ever completed.

 * internally on `signal.aborted` — so the `await task` site runs in both the
 * completed and aborted cases. We stamp ONLY when the refresh was NOT aborted,
 * so an interrupted refresh leaves the next one a genuine cold start.
 *
 * IMPORTANT — pass "did this refresh fail to complete its work", NOT
 * `signal.aborted` read at the stamp site. Those differ in a race: a refresh
 * can finish (commit + persist) and then have its `AbortController` aborted in
 * the SAME tick (the user navigates away the instant it resolves). Reading
 * `signal.aborted` afterward would see `true` and skip the stamp, wrongly
 * making the NEXT refresh a cold start that bypasses the freshness TTL even
 * though a refresh genuinely completed. Callers therefore track a
 * `refreshCompleted` flag set after the commit and pass `!refreshCompleted`
 * here — a post-completion abort can't flip it (#788 review).
