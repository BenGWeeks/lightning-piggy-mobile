/** Yield to the native event loop so UI interactions and paint can tick
 * between chunks of a synchronous decrypt loop (#177, #731).
 *
 * Why requestAnimationFrame instead of setTimeout(0):
 *   - `setTimeout(resolve, 0)` posts to the native timer queue; under load
 *     (83 active timers re-enqueued back-to-back by the decrypt loop) the
 *     Android Looper batches them into the same frame and fires them all
 *     inside a single `callTimers` JS→native→JS bridge call. The JS thread
 *     never actually returns to native between yields, inflating each
 *     "yield" to ~90 ms wall-clock (issue #731 audit Finding 2).
 *   - `requestAnimationFrame` is wired through the Choreographer vsync
 *     signal. Each RAF fires once per Choreographer tick; re-enqueueing
 *     from inside the callback schedules the NEXT tick, so the JS thread
 *     genuinely returns to native between iterations.
 *   - Do NOT use RN's `setImmediate`: RN shims it on top of
 *     `queueMicrotask`, which runs before the next task (no yield to
 *     native). Do NOT use `queueMicrotask` directly for the same reason.
 *   - `MessageChannel` is not reliably polyfilled in Hermes/RN.
 *
 * For the abort-aware scheduler in `createYieldScheduler` the RAF handle
 * is cancelable via `cancelAnimationFrame`, matching the
 * `clearTimeout` pattern used there. */

/** Cooperative-yield scheduler for the NIP-17 inbox loops (#532).
 *
 * Two improvements over the old `if (i % N === 0) await yieldToEventLoop()`
 * pattern:
 *
 * 1. **Time-budget yields.** We only pay for a `requestAnimationFrame`
 *    round-trip when wall-clock since the last yield exceeds
 *    `DECRYPT_FRAME_BUDGET_MS`. A run of cheap cache hits no longer
 *    forces a yield every Nth iteration even though there's been no
 *    blocking work. The count-based modulo still acts as a safety
 *    cap (set by the caller) so a pathological iteration that
 *    somehow underestimates its own runtime can't starve the thread.
 *
 * 2. **Hard-cancel on abort.** When the caller's `AbortSignal` fires
 *    mid-loop, an `abort` listener cancels the currently-pending RAF
 *    via `cancelAnimationFrame` and resolves the awaiter immediately.
 *    Without this, the loop would still drain one more vsync round-
 *    trip (plus whatever sync work follows it) before the next abort
 *    check — visible as a slug of pinned-thread time after a
 *    tab-switch blurs MessagesScreen.
 *
 * Returned object:
 * - `maybeYield()` — call once per loop iteration. No-op unless the
 *   frame budget is exceeded OR the safety-cap counter ticks.
 * - `yieldCount` — number of actual yields performed (perfLog).
 * - `dispose()` — detach the abort listener after the loop exits.

 * yields the JS thread regularly. The cache-hit path itself is cheap
 * (~ms), but on a >1000-wrap inbox the bulk processing piles up to
 * tens of seconds of unbroken JS work without a periodic yield, which
 * starves UI events (back-tap appears frozen — #286). Lowered from 8

 * breathing room for gorhom-bottom-sheet's open animation to schedule
