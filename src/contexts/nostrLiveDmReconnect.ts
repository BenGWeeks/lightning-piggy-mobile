// --- Live-sub self-re-arm on relay drop / app resume (#934) ---
// The app-wide SimplePool deliberately does NOT auto-reconnect
// (enableReconnect stays default-false app-wide), so when the wrap
// subscription's WebSocket silently drops — relay idle timeout, network
// change, Android Doze suspending the socket on background — the foreground
// live sub goes deaf and nothing re-opens it. The user then has to
// pull-to-refresh to see missed DMs (the #934 symptom). We mirror the
// background DM watch's self-re-arm (#958): the sub's `onWrapsClose` schedules
// a backoff-scheduled re-open, and an AppState 'active' listener re-arms on
// resume (Doze can freeze the JS engine before onWrapsClose ever fires). A
// generation counter guards against re-arming after an intentional teardown
// (logout / account switch / relay-list change), and re-arms are silent by
// construction — re-subscribing over healthy sockets reuses the pool's open
// connections, the `isFreshArrival` gate mutes the backlog replay, and
// `knownWrapIds` + `claimWrapNotification` prevent duplicate work / alerts.
//
// Extracted from `nostrLiveDmSub.ts` (#1039 review) — this module owns ONLY
// the connection lifecycle (open / backoff-reconnect / resume-rearm / the
// post-reconnect settle timer that flushes the blind window). Event decoding,
// decrypt, persistence, and inbox surfacing stay in `nostrLiveDmSub.ts`,
// which supplies this controller a plain `onEvent` callback.
